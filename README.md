I am a computer science student in my final year of study, excited to graduate this summer. I am particularly interested in internships related to Java and Spring Boot. I believe that gaining hands-on experience with these technologies would be a valuable asset to my future career as a computer scientist. I am seeking an opportunity to work with experienced professionals in the field and learn from them as I continue to develop my skills and knowledge.
